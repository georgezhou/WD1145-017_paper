\begin{abstract}
We present multi-wavelength photometric monitoring of the WD 1145+017, a white dwarf exhibiting periodic dimming events interpreted to be the transits of orbiting, evaporating planetesimals. Our observations range from the optical $g'$ band to the near infrared $J$ band, and recorded multiple transit events, with depths ranging from $\sim 20$ to $\sim 50$\%. Simultaneous near-infrared and optical observations of the largest planetesimal transit, over two epochs, revealed no large differences in the transit depth across the photometric pass bands, allowing us to constrain the grain size in the transiting debris cloud to be $<0.8\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ at $2\sigma$ significance. Large variations in the transit depths were seen over the 1 month temporal baseline, confirming the highly variable nature of the system.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The transit events detected around WD 1145+017 may be the first direct evidence for in-falling planetesimals polluting the atmosphere of a white dwarf. Photometric monitoring of the white dwarf by the \emph{K2} mission revealed a series of asymmetric transits, with depths of $\sim 40$\%, and periods of 4.5 to 4.9 hours \citep{2015Natur.526..546V}. The white dwarf also shows heavy element pollution in its spectra, and infrared excess in its spectral energy distribution \citep{2015Natur.526..546V,2016ApJ...816L..22X}. In addition, \citet{2016ApJ...816L..22X} reported that broadened absorption lines from heavy elements were superimposed on the sharp atmospheric metal lines, suggesting the presence of circumstellar material with orbital velocities of $\sim 300\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ surrounding the host star. Subsequent ground-based photometric monitoring revealed a series of semi-periodic dimming events \citep{2015Natur.526..546V,2015arXiv151006434C,2016ApJ...818L...7G,2016MNRAS.tmp..406R,2016arXiv160308823A}. Multiple events are often seen within a given period, with variable depths, as large as 60\%, and with life times as short as days. These observations have been interpreted as a series of transits by fragments of the debris cloud surrounding WD 1145+017, and are perhaps indicative of dust originating from evaporating planetesimals. The spectra of some 30 to 50\% of white dwarfs exhibit pollution from heavy elements \citep[e.g.][]{2003ApJ...596..477Z,2010ApJ...722..725Z,2014A&A...566A..34K}, 1 to 3 \% have detectable infrared excess suggestive of debris disks \citep[e.g.][]{2007ApJS..171..206M,2009ApJ...694..805F,2011MNRAS.417.1210G,2011ApJS..197...38D}. WD 1145+017 is the first found to exhibit probable transit events originating from the circumstellar material, and gives us an unique opportunity to study the dust properties before they are accreted onto the star. 

If a significant part of the transiting debris cloud is optically thin, then we should expect the depth and shape of the transits to be wavelength dependent. \citet{2015arXiv151006434C} reported a series of simultaneous $V$ and $R$ band light curves from May 2015, finding no depth differences in the transits. \citet{2016arXiv160308823A} reported spectrophotometric observations spanning 0.48 -- 0.92 $\mu$m with the OSIRIS on the 10.4\,m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), detecting a series transits ranging from 25 to 40\%, again finding no depth difference at multiple wavelength bins. The lack of wavelength-depth dependencies in the optical can exclude particles of $\lesssim 0.5\,\mu \mathrm{m}$ in the debris cloud. 

Despite the faintness of WD 1145+017, the deep transits make it an excellent target for multi-wavelength follow-up observations. In this study, we extend the wavelength baseline to the near infrared with $J$ band light curves over a series of nights, spanning one month, obtained at the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). Of which, two transits were observed simultaneously in the optical in a coordinated effort with a series of other facilities. This, as well as subsequent optical follow-up observations, allowed us to monitor for wavelength-depth dependencies and evolutions in the transits about the white dwarf.

\section{Observations and reduction}
\label{sec:observations}

We obtained a series of infrared observations from the AAT, optical observations with small telescopes in Australia, and follow-up $g'$ band observations with the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT) network. These observations are described below, and are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:observations}.

\subsection{AAT $J$ band observations}
\label{sec:obs_aat}

We obtained near infrared light curves for WD 1145+017 using the IRIS2 camera on the 3.9\,m AAT, located at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia. IRIS2 is a near infrared camera, with a $1\,\mathrm{K} \times 1\,\mathrm{K}$ HAWAII-1 HgCdTe infrared detector, read out over four quadrants, achieving a field of view of $7.7' \times 7.7 '$ and a pixel scale of $0.4486''\,\mathrm{pixel}^{-1}$. Our observations were performed in the $J$ band, at 30\,s integration time, and each exposure was read out in double-read mode. A photometric precision of $\sim 10\mathrm{\%}$ was achieved on each exposure. The observing strategy, data reduction, and photometry extraction procedures are laid out in \citet{2014MNRAS.445.2746Z} and \citet{2015MNRAS.454.3002Z}. Each sequence of light curves was obtained in guided mode, with the observer manually inputting additional corrections every $\sim 10$\,minutes to ensure the target and reference stars stay on the same pixel throughout. Dithered sequences bracketing the stare sequence provide the flat field and sky background corrections. Due to the faintness of the target, these observations were performed in focus, unlike standard IRIS2 photometric observations. Photometry of the target and reference stars were extracted from circular apertures at a series of radii, and the background is estimated by drawing annuli surrounding each aperture. The image coordinate matching and photometric extraction are performed using the \emph{FITSH} package \citep{2012MNRAS.421.1825P}. Reference photometry is performed against a selection of stable reference stars. Six extraction apertures were used, and the aperture that yields the lowest out-of-transit scatter is selected. However, the transit depth analyses presented in Section~\ref{sec:lightcurve_model} were tested against all extraction apertures, but the scatter in derived transit depths due to aperture selection is smaller than the statistical error per aperture by a factor of $>4$. 

Two full nights of AAT+IRIS2 observations were obtained on 2016-03-19 and 2016-03-20, simultaneous to optical observations from an array of small telescopes. Due to the inclement weather, only segments of light curves were recovered from the 2016-03-19 observation. The conditions were photometric on 2016-03-20, allowing an uninterrupted sequence of observations to be obtained. In additions, segments of observations were obtained over five nights in February 2016, on 2016-02-16,17,19,20,21, that provided a longer-term baseline to examine the evolution of the debris cloud in the infrared.

\subsection{Simultaneous optical observations from small telescopes}
\label{sec:simultaneous-optical}

Simultaneous optical observations were obtained on 2016-03-19 and 2016-03-20 from a series of facilities. Observations were obtained by the 0.32\,m Planewave CDK telescope at Hazelwood Observatory, operated by Chris Stockdale in Victoria, Australia. The observations were made with a SBIG ST8XME $1.5\mathrm{K}\times1 \mathrm{K}$ CCD detector, yielding a $18\times12'$ field of view and a $0.73''/\mathrm{pixel}$ plate scale. Due to the faintness of the target, no filter was used. The setup is fully described in \citet{2015arXiv150908953R}.

Observations over the two nights were also obtained at the Ellinbank observatory, Victoria, with the 0.32\,m Planewave CDK telescope, operated by Peter Nelson. The observations were obtained using the SBIG 3200 ME CCD camera, with a $2184\times1472$ detector, with a field of view of $20.2' \times 13.5'$ at a plate scale of 1.12''/pixel when read out at $2\times 2$ bin. The observations were performed over the optical (no filter) on 2016-03-19, and in the $R$ band on 2016-03-20. 

The Perth Exoplanet Survey Telescope (PEST) obtained observations on both nights. PEST is a fully automated observatory operating a 0.30\,m Meade LX200 Schmidt Cassegrain telescope, located in Perth, Western Australia, operated by TG Tan. The setup employs a SBIG ST-8XME detector, yielding a field of view of $31'\times 21'$ and a plate scale of $.12''/\mathrm{pixel}$. Observations were performed in the $V$ band, at an integration time of 240\,s, on both nights. Unfortunately, the photometric precision from 2016-03-20 were not sufficent to provide useful constraints on the $V$ band transit, and are left out of the analysis. The PEST setup is also fully described in \citet{2015arXiv150908953R}.

Each set of images were bias and dark subtracted, flat field corrected. Light curve extraction on the reduce frames were performed using aperture photometry via the \emph{FITSH} package, similar to the process in Section~\ref{sec:obs_aat}. Reference photometry against a largely consistent set of reference stars were performed (not fully consistent due to differences in field centroid and field of view). 

\subsection{Subsequent optical follow-up from LCOGT}
\label{sec:lcogt}

We obtained photometric observations using the LCOGT network within 5 days of our simultaneous infrared-optical campaign. The observations were performed on 2016-03-25 and 2016-03-28 using the 1\,m telescopes located at Sutherland observatory, South Africa, and on 2016-03-26 using an identical setup at Cerro Tololo observatory, Chile. An overlap of $\sim 2$ hours were available between the Cerro Tololo 2016-03-26 observations and that from Sutherland, allowing one transit to be captured simultaneously from both facilities. The observations were taken with the $4\mathrm{K} \times 4 \mathrm{K}$ SBIG STX-16803 camera, with a field of view of $15.8'\times 15.8'$ and a pixel scale of 0.464''/pixel when read out at $2\times 2$ bin. The observations were performed in the $g'$ band to provide a large wavelength baseline for comparison. The raw frames were processed with the automated LCOGT pipeline. Photometric extraction and reference photometry were extracted according to Section~\ref{sec:obs_aat}, via the \emph{FITSH} package. 

\section{Light curve analyses}
\label{sec:lightcurve_model}

\subsection{Global analysis of the simultaneous transit light curves}
\label{sec:simultaneous_lc}

The transits of WD 1145+017 evolve rapidly from orbit to orbit, and only simultaneous observations can give us a coherent analysis of the wavelength dependence of the transits. Following \citet{2012ApJ...752....1R} and \citet{2015arXiv151006434C}, we fit the transits by hyperbolic secant functions. Each transit is described by the parameters of transit depth $C_\mathrm{band}$, reference transit centroid $\tau_0$, and characteristic timescales for ingress $\tau_1$ and egress $\tau_2$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:model}
  F(t) = 1 - C \left( \exp{-(t-\tau0)/\tau1} + \exp{(t-\tau0)/\tau2} \right)^{-1}\,.
\end{equation}
We assume a common shape for the light curve at different bands, such that the $\tau_0$, $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ parameters are shared across the transits observed on a given night. The depth $C$ is left independent for each band, allowing us to probe for transit depth differences.

The best fit parameters and associated uncertainties are derived via a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, using the \emph{emcee} \citep{2013PASP..125..306F} affine invariant ensemble sampler. Since the transits are of short duration, we account for the long integration time of the follow-up optical light curves by fitting models that are smoothed by moving averages with windows corresponding to the respective exposure times. 

The observations and model fits for 2016-03-19 and 2016-03-20 are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lc_20160319} and Figure~\ref{fig:lc_20160320}. The $1\sigma$ set of models allowed by the data are shaded for each plot. The fit results are presented in Table~\ref{tab:simultaneous_params}. 

\begin{figure*}

    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{plots/20160319.eps}
    \caption{The light curves of WD 1145+017 from 2016-03-19, simultaneously observed by the AAT in the infrared $J$ band, and by a series of small telescopes in the optical. The individual AAT observations are plotted in grey, and the 5 min binned light curve in red. The error bars represent the mean uncertainty of the points within the bin, scaled by the square root of the number of points per bin. The light curves of the optical facilities are shown at their native cadence. The shaded areas represent the $1\sigma$ region in the model fit. The solid lines show the best fit models according to Equation~\ref{eq:model}. The optical light curves have their respective model fits and the model fits to the AAT $J$ band light curve (red) over plotted for comparison.}
    \label{fig:lc_20160319}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}

    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{plots/20160320.eps}
    \caption{The light curves of WD 1145+017 from 2016-03-20, simultaneously observed in the infrared by AAT and in the optical by a series of small telescoeps. See Figure~\ref{fig:lc_20160319} for description.}
    \label{fig:lc_20160320}
\end{figure*}

We measured no large difference in the depth of the transit at difference photometric bands. Following \citet{2015arXiv151006434C}, the depth $D$ (the minimum of the transit) is given by: 
\begin{equation}
D = C \frac{\zeta^{\zeta/(1+\zeta)} }{1+\zeta}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\zeta = \tau_2/\tau_1$. Figure~\ref{fig:depth_hist} shows the posterior distribution for the derived depths of the transits at each band for each of the nights. We find no change to the transit depth and shape between the two nights, with $\tau_1 = 0.005\pm0.001$, $\tau_2 = 0.005\pm0.001$ on 2016-03-19 and $\tau_1 = 0.004\pm0.001$, $\tau_2 = 0.006\pm0.001$ on 2016-03-20. This is an important test, since the transit shape is known to change on a short time scale, and allows us to combine the data from the two nights. 

We fit the data from both nights together, with all transits sharing the characteristic timescale parameters $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$, and each band with an independent depth parameter $C$. The reference transit time $\tau_0$ and transit period $P$ are also fitted for, and shared globally. The resulting transit depth posteriors are plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:depth_hist}. No large difference in the transit depths were measured, with all depths agreeing to within $1\sigma$. The full set of derived parameter values are given in Table~\ref{tab:simultaneous_params}. Interestingly, we also find no significant asymmetry was measured for the transits, differing from the transits one month earlier (Section~\ref{sec:single_band_lc}).

The transits from each night were fit simultaneously, sharing the parameters governing the transit shape, but with different depths for each band. The transit depths agree between each photometric band, and between the two nights, at the $1\sigma$ level. The bottom panel shows the depth distribution derive from fitting the data from both nights simultaneously, with all transit shape parameters shared, and per-band transit depth independent. Again, the transit depths from each photometric band agree to within $1\sigma$.}

\subsection{Light curves from single-band observations}
\label{sec:single_band_lc}

In addition to the simultaneous set of multi-wavelength observations, we also obtained $J$ band AAT light curves during five nights in February 2016, and two nights of $g'$ band light curves with the LCOGT 1\,m network in March 2016. 

Figure~\ref{fig:lc_201602} shows the light curves from the February AAT $J$ band observations. Two full transit events were observed on 2016-02-16 and 2016-02-21. The light curves were fit with the same procedure as per Section~\ref{sec:simultaneous_lc}, with the transit shape and depth assumed to be constant over the five nights. The transits were significantly shallower than those observed in March 2016 (with depths of $D=0.17_{-0.03}^{+0.03}$) and exhibit significantly asymmetric ingress and egress timescales of $\tau_1 = 0.006_{-0.001}^{+0.001}$ and $\tau_2 = 0.0003_{-0.0003}^{+0.0003}$. In fact, the same hyderbolic secant function cannot fully model the 2016-02-16 and 2016-02-21 transits. Fitting the two transit separately, we find the depth and shape to evolve over the 5 nights. The transit on 2016-02-16 has a depth of $D = 0.12_{-0.05}^{+0.14}$, $\tau_1 = 0.003_{-0.002}^{+0.004}$ and $\tau_2 = 0.001_{-0.001}^{+0.002}$, while the transit on 2016-02-21 was deeper and longer, with $D = 0.19_{-0.03}^{+0.03}$, $\tau_1 = 0.009_{-0.002}^{+0.002}$ and $\tau_2 = 0.0009_{-0.0004}^{+0.0006}$. The period derived from the transits $(P=0.18716_{-0.00003}^{+0.00003})$ is not significantly different from that in Table~\ref{tab:simultaneous_params} found in the March observations.

The shaded region represents the $1\sigma$ regime for the allowed models, assuming the transits can be described by a single model. The bottom panel shows the phase binned light curve and model.}
    \label{fig:lc_201602}
\end{figure*}

Observations were also performed with the LCOGT 1\,m network on 2016-03-25/26 and 2016-03-28, $\sim 5$ nights after the AAT observations (Figure~\ref{fig:lcogt}). The system had evolved significantly over the five days, with LCOGT light curves showing five distinct transit event. We fit the light curves with a doublet transit, allowing for a shared $\tau_0$ and period. The primary component transits with a depth of $D = 0.41_{-0.03}^{+0.02}$, and exhibits some asymmetry with $\tau_1 = 0.003_{-0.0003}^{+0.0009}$ and $\tau_2 = 0.0048_{-0.0004}^{+0.0003}$. The secondary component has a shallower transit of $D = 0.19_{-0.02}^{+0.01}$, and exhibits some asymmetry with $\tau_1 = 0.0013_{-0.0002}^{+0.0003}$ and $\tau_2 = 0.013_{-0.003}^{+0.003}$. In both cases, the egress is longer than ingress, suggesting a trailing tail-like feature. The two transits are offset by $0.0164_{-0.0007}^{+0.0007}$ days. The period derived from the dataset is $0.18727_{-0.00001}^{+0.00002}$ days, largely consistent with the period of the system at 2016-03-19/20, and the transit centroid agrees to within uncertainties. The depth of the primary event is 20\% shallower than that observed 5 nights earlier, again indicative of significant evolution the system. 

Fitting the two nights separately, we find a slight evolution in the depth of the secondary component, with $D=0.24_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$ on 2016-30-25/26, and $0.19_{-0.01}^{+0.01}$ on 2016-03-28. The primary component registered no significant change in transit depth, nor did we detect any significant change in the transit timing offset between the primary and the secondary.

Transits by the secondary fragment were not detected in the set of AAT and small telescope observations five days earlier, nor were any asymmetry detected in the transits by the primary fragment. From the LCOGT light curves, the secondary fragment transited $0.0164_{-0.0007}^{+0.0007}$ days earlier than the primary, implying an orbital period $\sim 1\,\mathrm{min/orbit}$ shorter than that of the primary fragment, consistent with the drift rates of smaller fragments found by \citet{2016MNRAS.tmp..406R}.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

This study presents three sets of observations that capture the transits of debris clouds surround the white dwarf WD 1145+017. Simultaneous observations were obtained in the Clear, $V$, $R$, and $J$ bands on 2016-03-19 and 2016-03-20, recording two 50\% transit events. The depths derived from each band agreed to within $1\sigma$ on each individual night, and from the combined light curve of the two nights. AAT $J$ band light curves over five nights in February 2016, and LCOGT $g'$ band light curves in late March 2016, recorded dramatic changes to the transit depths of the system over the one month baseline. The transits were significantly shallower in February 2016 ($\sim 20$\%), and a secondary transiting fragment developed within the five days between the follow-up LCOGT observations and those from the AAT. 

\subsection{Wavelength dependence}

The transit depths, derived from the 2016-03-19 and 2016-03-20 transits are plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:band_depth}. The photometric band passes, scaled by flux of the white dwarf, are also plotted. If we assume a linear fit can describe the transit depths as a function of wavelength, then the depths derived from the simutlaneous depth fits to the two nights is consistent with a blue-ward slope to the transit depths of $-0.11_{-0.04}^{+0.06}\,\mu\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, at $2\sigma$ significance. The power to this blue-ward trend largely originates from the 2016-03-19 observations, which exhibit the same wavelength-depth slope. The larger uncertainties from the optical observations on the second night prevents us from confirming the existence of the wavelength-depth slope. Given the variable nature of the transit depth and shape, and the low significance of the detection, this tentative Rayleigh scattering signal should be treated with caution.

We calculate extinction cross sections for a power law distribution of spherical particles \citep[as defined by ][]{1974SSRv...16..527H} with effective radii from 0.05 to 20.0\,$\mu$m, and effective variance 0.1. The optical properties are those of "astronomical silicate" \citep{1984ApJ...285...89D,1993ApJ...402..441L}. The extinction was calculated using the Lorenz-Mie scattering code of \citet{2002sael.book.....M}, assuming the entire transiting cloud is optically thin. Under these assumptions, we can rule out particles of sizes $<0.8\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ at $2\sigma$ significance, consistent with previous studies \citep{,2015arXiv151006434C,2016arXiv160308823A}. We also note the $1\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ model is slightly preferred over that of larger particle sizes, but this tentative interpretation is heavily dependent on the robustness of the blue-ward trend. Figure~\ref{fig:band_depth} shows a selection of the models from 0.5 to 5.0\,$\mu$m to illustrate the expected extinction curves.

We find no strong evidence for any wavelength dependence of the transit depth. Extinction curves for particles 0.5 to 5.0\,$\mu$m are plotted for comparison. The particle sizes can be constrained to be $\gtrsim 0.8\,\mu$m.}

For comparison, short period, asymmetric, variable transits have been detected about three main sequence stars to date \citep{2012ApJ...752....1R,2014ApJ...784...40R,2015ApJ...812..112S}, are are interpreted as debris clouds surrounding disintegrating / evaporating terrestial planets. Of which, observations from \citet{2014ApJ...786..100C} yielded a null detection of depth-colour dependence for KIC 12557548 b, while \citet{2015ApJ...800L..21B} claimed a tentatively deeper transit in the $u'$ and $g'$ bands compared to that in the $z'$ band, suggestive of dust particles of 0.25 to 1 $\mu$m in size. GTC spectrophotometric follow-up of K2-22b measured a slightly deeper transit in the bluer wavelength bins in at least one of the transits observed, suggestive of particle sizes of 0.2 to 0.4 $\mu$m. In this context, the lack of strong colour dependence of the WD 1145+017 transits are largely consistent with these previous systems.

\subsection{Spectral energy distribution}

As a sanity check to the grain size derived from the non-dependence of transit depth on wavelength revealed by the simultaneous optical and near-infrared measurements, we may consider WD 1145+017's spectral energy distribution (SED) presented in Fig. \ref{fig:wd1145p017_sed}. Here we compile photometry spanning optical and near-infrared wavelengths from 0.3 to 4.6~$\mu$m combining measurements from SDSS \citep[$ugriz$;][]{2011ApJS..193...29A}, UKIDSS \citep[$YJHK$;][]{2007MNRAS.379.1599L}, and \textit{WISE} \citep[W1 and W2 -- W3 and W4 are upper limits that do not constrain the SED;][]{2010AJ....140.1868W}. A summary of the photometry used in the modelling is presented in Table \ref{tab:wd1145p017_phot}.

To model the dust emission we assume the white dwarf has the physical properties adopted in \cite{2015Natur.526..546V}, i.e. $d = 174~$pc, $T_{\rm eff} = 15,900~$K, $R_{\rm WD} = 1.4~R_{\oplus}$, and $M_{\rm WD} = 0.6~M_{\odot}$. From these we calculate a luminosity of $L_{\rm WD} = 9.5\times10^{-3}~L_{\odot}$. This is too low for there to be a blowout radius (i.e. a grain size below which the radiation force dominates gravitational force) for dust around the white dwarf. 

However, the minimum size of dust grains around WD 1145+017 can be constrained from the thermal emission. To model this we adopt a model of an optically thin, annular disc with dust in a power law size distribution that are composed of pure astronomical silicate. The model has several parameters and we have a limited number of excess data points to fit, so we make several simplifying assumptions. We assume that the disc has an inner edge, $R_{\rm in}$, at the same semi-major axis as the parent planetesimal, which for an orbital period of $\sim$~4.5~hrs around a 0.6~$M_{\odot}$ body is $5.42\times10^{-3}$~au. The disc is assumed to be relatively compact with a width $\Delta R/R = 0.1$, such that the outer edge of the disc is at a distance $R_{\rm out} = 5.96\times10^{-3}~$au. The size distribution of dust grains is fixed between a minimum size of $a_{\rm min}$ and maximum size of 1~mm. The dust is assumed to be in a steady state collisional cascade, such that the exponent of the size distribution power law is 3.5 \citep{1969JGR....74.2531D}.

Greyed out data points are the excess flux at the wavelength of observation. Uncertainties are 1-$\sigma$. The solid black line is the combined white dwarf+disc model. The dashed black and grey lines denote the white dwarf and disc contributions to the total. \label{fig:wd1145p017_sed}}
\end{figure}

A least squares fit of the model with $a_{\rm min}$ as the only free parameter produces a best fit of $a_{\rm min} = 10.0^{+4.5}_{-3.2}~\mu$m, with a $\chi^{2}_{red}$ of 1.5 (three free parameters). The disc fractional luminosity ($L_{\rm dust}/L_{\rm WD}$) is calculated to be 3.2$\times10^{-3}$. The dust mass inferred from the model is 1.3$\times10^{19}$~g, about 1 per cent of the mass in fragments calculated by \cite{2015Natur.526..546V}. The grain size estimated here is consistent with that inferred for the dust from the flat transit depth between optical and near-infrared wavelengths.
